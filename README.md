# Text Signature

## About

<img alt="Hello World" height="200" src="screenshots/Welcome.png" width="800"/>

A Console App That Beautify Text with Currently Two Fonts:

- **Roman**
- **Medium**

That's it, really.

It's also made as a Project for [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) Kotlin Basics Track, with few Customizations of my own 😎

## How Can It Be Improved?

It would be Great If artistic people contributed by adding new fonts, as two fonts isn't really that much.
